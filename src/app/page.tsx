          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed font-light mb-4 text-center">
            Hi! I&apos;m Jirapat Kantaros, a graphic design student based in Chiang Mai. My journey in design began with a love for art and storytelling. Over the years, I&apos;ve developed a passion for visual communication and enjoy using design to solve problems and inspire others. I believe that good design is not just about aesthetics, but about making meaningful connections.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed font-light mb-4 text-center">
            I am inspired by simplicity, clarity, and the power of color. My approach is to create designs that are both beautiful and functional, always keeping the user&apos;s experience in mind. I love experimenting with new styles and techniques, and I am always eager to learn and grow as a designer.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed font-light text-center">
            When I&apos;m not designing, you can find me exploring new cafes, traveling, or capturing moments with my camera. I also enjoy reading, music, and spending time with friends and family. These experiences fuel my creativity and help me bring fresh perspectives to my work.
